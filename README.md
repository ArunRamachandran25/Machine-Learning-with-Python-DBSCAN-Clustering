# Machine-Learning-with-Python-DBSCAN-Clustering
Density-based Clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Density, in this context, is defined as the number of points within a specified radius.  In this section, the main focus will be manipulating the data and properties of DBSCAN and observing the resulting clustering.
